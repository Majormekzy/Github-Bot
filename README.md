# GitHub Bot for Automated Pull Request Deployment

This project implements a GitHub Bot using Probot to automate the deployment of pull requests (PRs) into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes. The bot also provides real-time deployment status updates and cleans up containers upon PR closure.

## Features

- Automated deployment of pull requests into Docker containers.
- Real-time status updates and links to deployed environments.
- Cleanup of Docker containers upon PR closure.
- Integration with GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- An AWS EC2 instance for hosting the bot (optional for local development).
- A GitHub App with appropriate permissions and webhook configuration.

## Setup

### GitHub App Configuration

1. **Create a GitHub App**:
   - Go to [GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) and create a new app.
   - Set the homepage URL to your project’s homepage.
   - Set the webhook URL to your server’s address (e.g., `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000`).
   - Generate a webhook secret and note it down.
   - Set the following permissions:
     - **Repository Permissions**:
       - Pull requests: Read & Write
       - Issues: Read & Write
       - Contents: Read & Write
       - Deployments: Read & Write
       - Metadata: Read Only (mandatory)
       - Commit statuses: Read & Write
       - Checks: Read & Write
     - **Subscribe to Events**:
       - Pull request
       - Push
       - Issue comment

2. **Generate a Private Key**:
   - Generate and download a private key. Save it securely as it will be used for authentication.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Github-Bot.git
   cd Github-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
     ```plaintext
     APP_ID=your-app-id
     PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=path/to/your/private-key.pem
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
     LOG_LEVEL=info
     ```

4. **Start the Probot App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Deploying to an EC2 Instance

1. **SSH into Your EC2 Instance**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository on EC2**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Github-Bot.git
   cd Github-Bot
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and configure it as described in the [Local Development Setup](#local-development-setup).

5. **Change Permissions on the Private Key**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 path/to/your/private-key.pem
   ```

6. **Start the Probot App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
APP_ID=your-app-id
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=path/to/your/private-key.pem
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Usage

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Open a new pull request in your GitHub repository.
   - The Probot app will automatically build and deploy the PR into a Docker container.

2. **Check Deployment Status**:
   - The bot will comment on the pull request with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.

3. **Close the Pull Request**:
   - When the PR is closed, the bot will clean up the Docker container associated with the PR.

## GitHub Actions

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/pr-deployment.yml` file:

```yaml
name: PR Deployment

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, closed]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Run Docker container
        run: docker run -d --name my-app-${{ github.sha }} -p 8080:80 my-app:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Update Docker container
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'synchronize'
        run: |
          docker stop my-app-${{ github.sha }}
          docker rm my-app-${{ github.sha }}
          docker run -d --name my-app-${{ github.sha }} -p 8080:80 my-app:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Cleanup Docker container
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'closed'
        run: |
          docker stop my-app-${{ github.sha }}
          docker rm my-app-${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Comment on PR
        run: |
          curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
            -d '{"body": "Deployment successful: http://<your-url>"}' \
            ${{ github.event.pull_request.comments_url }}
```
